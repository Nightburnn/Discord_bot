## Questions
These are ALX_AFRICA questions for the API Advance projects meant for python. All i did was tweak the questions to suit React function component

* 0-subs.js : Write a React function component that queries the Reddit API and displays the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the component should display an error message indicating that the subreddit is invalid.

Hint: No authentication is necessary for most features of the Reddit API. If you’re getting errors related to Too Many Requests, ensure you’re setting a custom User-Agent.

Requirements:

Function component should be named SubredditSubscribers
Function component should accept a subreddit prop indicating the subreddit to query
If the subreddit is valid, display the number of subscribers
If the subreddit is invalid, display an error message indicating that the subreddit is invalid. Note: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.
